# Category Review & Modification Implementation Plan (VS004)

## Overview

This vertical slice focuses on enabling users to review and modify AI-assigned categories before submitting transactions to YNAB. Since the full Transaction Management UI (VS002) is scheduled for Phase 2, this slice will include a minimal transaction viewing capability specifically designed for category review.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Minimal Transaction View for Category Review

A focused transaction list view with limited functionality:

- Simple tabular display of transactions
- Essential columns only:
  - Date
  - Description/Payee
  - Amount
  - Assigned Category
  - Confidence Score
- Basic filters for:
  - Low confidence scores
  - Uncategorized transactions
  - Recently modified categories
- No advanced search, sorting, or detailed transaction views (these will be part of VS002)

### 2. Category Editor

Individual transaction category editing:

- In-line editing capability for single transactions
- Category dropdown with hierarchical organization
- Search functionality within dropdown
- Recently used categories section
- Confidence score indicator
- Save/cancel buttons

### 3. Bulk Category Editor

Multiple transaction category editing:

- Selection mechanism for multiple transactions
- Bulk editing controls
- Apply single category to multiple transactions
- Warning for overriding existing categories
- Confirmation of bulk changes

### 4. Category Consistency Checker

Identify inconsistent categorization patterns:

- Flag transactions with inconsistent categories compared to similar transactions
- Provide suggestions for alignment
- Allow easy acceptance/rejection of suggestions

### 5. Category Learning System

Backend support for improving future categorization:

- Record manual category corrections
- Associate transaction patterns with correct categories
- Apply learning to future categorization attempts

## Implementation Steps

1. Create domain models for category review and modification
2. Implement the minimal transaction view component
3. Develop category editor components (single and bulk)
4. Implement consistency checker
5. Build category learning system
6. Create integration with AI categorization system (VS003)
7. Develop comprehensive tests for all components

## UI Design Notes

- The minimal transaction view will be designed for category review first, not general transaction management
- Focus on making category modification efficient and intuitive
- Use color coding to indicate confidence levels
- Provide clear visual feedback for modified categories

## Technical Considerations

- This implementation must be compatible with the future VS002 (Transaction Management UI)
- The minimal transaction view will be replaced/enhanced by VS002, so avoid overbuilding
- Ensure the category learning system records data in a way that's useful for future AI training

## Dependencies

- Requires VS001 (Basic Transaction Import) for transaction data
- Requires VS003 (AI-Powered Categorization) for initial category assignments
- Will be extended by VS002 (Transaction Management UI) in Phase 2

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can view a list of transactions with their AI-assigned categories
- Users can modify categories for individual transactions
- Users can apply bulk category changes to multiple transactions
- System identifies inconsistent categorization patterns and offers suggestions
- System records category modifications to improve future categorization
- All scenarios in category_review.feature pass
