Feature: Submission to YNAB
  As a finance team member
  I want to submit properly categorized transactions to YNAB
  So that my budget data is updated automatically and accurately

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a finance team member
    And there are categorized transactions ready for submission

  # UI Component: TransactionSelectionControls
  @ui-prototype
  Scenario: Validate transaction selection UI prototype
    Given I am presented with the transaction selection prototype
    When I interact with the selection controls
    Then I should be able to select individual transactions
    And I should be able to select all transactions with a single action
    And I should be able to filter transactions by status
    And I should see a count of selected transactions

  # UI Component: SubmissionResultsView
  @ui-prototype
  Scenario: Validate submission results UI prototype
    Given I am presented with the submission results prototype
    When I interact with the results view
    Then I should see a summary of submitted transactions
    And I should see details for any failed submissions
    And I should see a link to view the transactions in YNAB
    And I should see an option to retry failed submissions

  # User Flow: Basic Submission
  @user-flow
  Scenario: Successfully submit transactions to YNAB
    Given I am viewing the transaction list with categorized transactions
    When I select 5 transactions with "Categorized" status
    And I click the "Submit to YNAB" button
    Then the system should connect to YNAB API
    And submit the selected transactions with their categories
    And update their status to "Submitted"
    And display a confirmation showing "5 transactions successfully submitted to YNAB"

  # Edge Case: Duplicate Prevention
  @edge-case
  Scenario: Prevent duplicate submission to YNAB
    Given I have previously submitted transactions to YNAB
    And those transactions are still in the system with "Submitted" status
    When I attempt to select and submit the same transactions again
    Then the system should identify them as already submitted
    And prevent the resubmission
    And display a warning message "5 transactions are already submitted to YNAB"

  # Domain Concept: Submission Validation
  @domain-discovery
  Scenario: Verify submission validation rules
    Given I have selected transactions for submission
    When the system validates the transactions before submission
    Then it should verify that each transaction has a valid category
    And it should verify that each transaction has not been previously submitted
    And it should verify that each transaction has all required fields for YNAB
    And only transactions that pass all validation should be submitted
