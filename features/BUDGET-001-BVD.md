## Implementation Recommendation

### Recommended Delivery Approach
- **Phase 1 (MVS)**: Week 1-2
  - Implement core domain model, API integrations, and basic UI
  - Focus on resilient end-to-end transaction flow
  - Key metrics: Successful import/export rate, time saved vs manual process
  
- **Phase 2 (Categorization)**: Week 2-3
  - Implement AI categorization with manual correction capabilities
  - Add domain events for improved system integration
  - Key metrics: Categorization accuracy, manual correction rate, end-to-end processing time

- **Phase 3 (Efficiency)**: Week 3-4
  - Add productivity enhancements for working with larger datasets
  - Implement dashboard and performance optimizations
  - Key metrics: User satisfaction, time spent on transaction management, performance metrics

### Decision Points
Critical points for evaluating whether to proceed with subsequent phases:

1. **After MVS Deployment**:
   - Metrics to evaluate: Successfully imported and exported transactions, processing time, error rate
   - Threshold for proceeding: At least 90% successful transaction processing, < 5% error rate
   - Potential pivot opportunities: Simplify YNAB integration if issues arise, adjust error handling approach

2. **After Phase 2 Deployment**:
   - Metrics to evaluate: AI categorization accuracy, user correction rate, user feedback
   - Threshold for proceeding: At least 80% categorization accuracy (per NFR1)
   - Potential pivot opportunities: Implement rules-based categorization if AI underperforms

3. **During Phase 3 Development**:
   - Metrics to evaluate: System performance under load, UI responsiveness
   - Threshold for success: Import processing >= 10 transactions/second (per NFR specs), UI response <= 2 seconds

### Critical Technical Foundations
Components that must be implemented first for technical reasons, regardless of business value:

- Transaction Domain Model: Foundation for all business logic
- PostgreSQL Database: Required as the central storage for all other components
- Error Handling Framework: Essential for building resilient integrations
- Transaction Status Tracking: Required for workflow management

## Risks and Mitigations

### Value Delivery Risks
- **Risk 1**: API limitations or changes in Fio Bank or YNAB
  - Impact: Could prevent basic functionality from working
  - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and monitoring; maintain documentation of API usage; create adapters to isolate API-specific code

- **Risk 2**: AI categorization accuracy below expectations
  - Impact: Would require more manual corrections, reducing time savings
  - Mitigation: Plan for incremental improvement of AI model; prepare fallback to rules-based categorization; implement feedback loop to improve categorization over time

- **Risk 3**: Performance issues with larger transaction volumes
  - Impact: Poor user experience, missed performance requirements
  - Mitigation: Implement pagination and lazy loading; optimize database queries; set up performance testing early

- **Risk 4**: Network reliability issues affecting integration
  - Impact: Failed or incomplete transaction processing
  - Mitigation: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff; develop a transaction recovery process; provide clear error messages to users
