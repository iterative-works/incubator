## Pre-implementation Requirements Checklist

### Documentation Review
- [x] Complete [Feature Implementation Plan](./BUDGET-001-implementation-plan.md) document
- [x] Create [Gherkin feature file](./BUDGET-001.feature) with all scenarios
- [x] Set up [Progress tracking document](./BUDGET-001-progress-tracking.md)
- [ ] Review all implementation guides referenced in the plan:
  - [ ] Functional Core Architecture Guide
  - [ ] ZIO Service Pattern Guide
  - [ ] Domain Events Implementation Guide
  - [ ] Ports and Adapters Pattern Guide
  - [ ] Mock Implementation Guide
  - [ ] ZIO Test Implementation Guide
  - [ ] View Model Pattern Guide
  - [ ] Scalatags + HTMX Guide
  - [ ] HTTP Controller Pattern Guide
  - [ ] UI Testing Guide
  - [ ] External System Integration Guide
  - [ ] Magnum Repository Guide
  - [ ] Integration Testing Guide
- [ ] Create or update necessary TODO items for transaction processing and YNAB integration

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify ZIO services are available in environment:
  - [ ] HTTP4S for web server
  - [ ] ZIO Config for configuration management
  - [ ] ZIO Logging for structured logging
  - [ ] ZIO Json for serialization
  - [ ] Magnum for database access
- [ ] Set up database connections for transaction storage
- [ ] Configure external API access for Fio Bank, OpenAI, and YNAB
- [ ] Set up TestContainers for integration testing environment
- [ ] Configure feature flags for phased rollout

### Dependency Verification
- [ ] Source Account Management bounded context available for integration
- [ ] YNAB Integration context mapping established
- [ ] External system credentials obtained:
  - [ ] Fio Bank API credentials
  - [ ] YNAB API token
  - [ ] OpenAI API key
- [ ] Database migrations planned for transaction and category tables
- [ ] All required libraries added to build.sbt:
  - [ ] ZIO ecosystem libraries
  - [ ] Magnum for database access
  - [ ] HTTP client libraries
  - [ ] Scalatags and HTMX for UI components

## Implementation Process Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. Clone/pull the latest code from the repository
2. Create a new branch following the naming convention: `feature/budget-001-fio-ynab-integration`
3. Review the entire Feature Implementation Plan before starting
4. Set up necessary environment configurations:
   - Database connection
   - External API credentials
   - Test containers for integration testing

### Implementation Workflow
1. Follow the implementation steps in the order specified in the plan:
   - Step 1: Core Domain Entities and Value Objects
   - Step 2: Domain Services and Repository Interfaces
   - Step 3: Domain Event Implementation
   - Etc. (follow the 13-step sequence in the plan)
2. For each step:
   - Review the relevant implementation guide
   - Implement according to the guide's specifications
   - Write tests according to the testing strategy
   - Update the progress tracking document after completing the step
3. Special considerations for this feature:
   - Implement transaction batching for performance
   - Use optimistic locking for concurrent transaction processing
   - Implement caching strategy for categories

### Coding Standards
1. Follow the project's architectural guidelines:
   - Functional Core/Imperative Shell pattern for transaction processing
   - Clear separation between pure domain logic and external integrations
   - Immutable domain entities with controlled state transitions
2. Apply code style guidelines:
   - 4-space indentation, 100 column limit
   - New Scala 3 syntax without braces for domain entities
   - End markers for service implementations (likely to exceed 5 lines)
3. Adhere to naming conventions:
   - Domain concepts use CamelCase following ubiquitous language (Transaction, Category)
   - Methods express clear intent (e.g., importTransactions, categorizeTransaction, submitToYNAB)
4. Feature-specific standards:
   - Use ZIO effects for all IO operations and error handling
   - Never throw exceptions in domain or infrastructure code
   - Implement proper caching for repeated database lookups

### Communication Protocols
1. Update the progress tracking document at the end of each day
2. Document any questions, issues, or decisions in the Questions & Decisions section
3. For discovered requirements:
   - Document in the progress tracking document
   - Assess impact on existing plan
   - Consult with team before making significant deviations
4. Daily check-ins for:
   - External API integration status
   - Database performance metrics
   - AI categorization accuracy feedback
