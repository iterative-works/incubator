### Implementation Approach
- [x] Starting with Self-Learning Payee Cleanup Processing (MVS)
- [x] Following phased implementation:
  - Phase 1: Basic LLM Integration
  - Phase 2: Rule Generation
  - Phase 3: Feedback Mechanism
- [x] Integration with existing TransactionProcessor planned
- [x] UI components for payee cleanup and rule management identified

## Technical Details for Kickoff

### Key Domain Objects
1. **PayeeCleanupRule**:
   ```scala
   case class PayeeCleanupRule(
       id: String,
       pattern: String,
       patternType: String, // regex, contains, startsWith
       replacement: String,
       confidence: Double,
       generatedBy: String, // "llm" or "human"
       status: RuleStatus, // pending, approved, rejected
       usageCount: Int,
       successRate: Double,
       createdAt: java.time.Instant,
       updatedAt: Option[java.time.Instant]
   )

   enum RuleStatus:
       case Pending, Approved, Rejected
   ```

2. **PayeeCleanupService Interface**:
   ```scala
   trait PayeeCleanupService:
       // Main cleanup method
       def cleanupPayee(
           original: String,
           context: Map[String, String]
       ): Task[(String, Option[PayeeCleanupRule])]

       // Rule management
       def getPendingRules(): Task[Seq[PayeeCleanupRule]]
       def getApprovedRules(): Task[Seq[PayeeCleanupRule]]
       def approveRule(ruleId: String, modifications: Option[Map[String, String]] = None): Task[PayeeCleanupRule]
       def rejectRule(ruleId: String, reason: Option[String] = None): Task[Unit]

       // Feedback mechanism
       def provideFeedback(ruleId: String, wasSuccessful: Boolean): Task[Unit]
   ```

### Database Changes
New tables required:
1. `payee_cleanup_rules` - For storing rule definitions and metadata
2. `payee_rule_applications` - For tracking rule usage and success rate

### Value Increments
1. **MVS (Week 1)**: Basic LLM Integration
   - LLM payee cleanup without rule generation
   - Integration with TransactionProcessor

2. **Value Increment 1 (Week 2)**: Rule Generation
   - Rule suggestion from LLM
   - Rule storage and management
   - Rule application

3. **Value Increment 2 (Week 3)**: Feedback Mechanism
   - UI for rule review and approval
   - Feedback collection
   - Performance metrics

### Dependencies
1. OpenAI API access for LLM integration
2. Existing TransactionProcessor for transaction handling
3. Categorization bounded context for service location

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement caching for OpenAI API calls to reduce costs?
2. How should we handle very long transaction descriptions in the LLM prompt?
3. What confidence threshold should we use for automatically applying rules vs. requiring review?

## Known Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk**: OpenAI API rate limits and costs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, batch processing, rule application first

2. **Risk**: Low quality rule suggestions
   - **Mitigation**: Human review process, performance tracking

3. **Risk**: Complex rule database management
   - **Mitigation**: Periodic cleanup, rule consolidation

## Next Steps
1. Create development branch `feature/BUDGET-001-payee-cleanup`
2. Implement domain models in categorization bounded context
3. Create PostgreSQL migrations for new tables
4. Implement OpenAI client
5. Set up Progress Tracking document
