# Bounded Context Migration Progress Report - 2026-04-08

## Accomplishments Today

Today we made significant progress in our DDD-based bounded context migration:

1. **Completed Categorization Context Migration**:
   - Migrated domain models (CategoryRule, CategorySuggestion)
   - Migrated service interfaces (CategorizationService)
   - Created appropriate directory structure
   - Updated migration task list to reflect completion

2. **Completed Auth Context Migration**:
   - Migrated domain models (Permission, Role, User)
   - Migrated service interfaces (AuthenticationService, UserService)
   - Created appropriate directory structure
   - Updated migration task list to reflect completion

3. **Verified Project Status**:
   - Project compiles successfully
   - Unit tests pass successfully
   - E2E tests fail as expected (they require a running server)

4. **Documented Migration Progress**:
   - Updated migration summary document
   - Created detailed logs for Categorization and Auth context migrations
   - Revised task list with remaining items

## Issues Encountered

1. **Backward Compatibility Challenges**:
   - Initial attempt to use Scala 3 export directives caused compilation errors
   - Removed export directives as a temporary solution
   - Need to research the correct syntax for exports or alternative approaches

## Next Steps

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Research correct approach for maintaining backward compatibility
   - Implement approach across all migrated files

2. **YNAB Service Implementation**:
   - Implement YnabServiceImpl according to the integration plan
   - Place implementation in the new bounded context structure

3. **Import Statement Updates**:
   - Update import statements across the codebase to use the new package structure
   - Verify compilation after each batch of updates

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress in our migration to a DDD-compliant architecture. All five bounded contexts (Transaction, YNAB, Fio, Categorization, and Auth) have been successfully migrated to their new locations. The primary remaining tasks are implementing backward compatibility, updating import statements, and completing the YnabServiceImpl implementation.

The project remains in a compilable state, and unit tests are passing, indicating a successful migration process so far.
