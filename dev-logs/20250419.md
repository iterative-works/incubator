# Development Log: 2025-04-19

## Feature: FIOYNAB-001 (Fio Bank to YNAB Integration)

### Planning and Design

Today's work focused on planning and designing the Self-Learning Payee Cleanup System, which is the critical component identified in our Business Value Decomposition. This component will significantly improve the data quality of payee information before it's sent to YNAB.

#### Design Decisions

1. **Self-Learning Approach**: 
   Instead of a traditional rule-based system, we've designed a self-learning system that:
   - Uses LLM to clean payee names AND generate rule patterns
   - Starts with no predefined rules and builds them over time
   - Includes a review workflow for suggested rules
   - Tracks rule performance metrics to continuously improve

   Rationale: This approach gives us immediate value through LLM-based cleanup while reducing API costs over time as rules are established. It also maintains human oversight while automating the improvement process.

2. **Rule Model Design**:
   ```scala
   case class PayeeCleanupRule(
       id: String,
       pattern: String,           // The pattern to match
       patternType: String,       // Type of pattern: "exact", "contains", "regex"
       replacement: String,       // The cleaned payee name
       confidence: Double,        // Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
       generatedBy: String,       // "llm" or "human"
       status: RuleStatus,        // "pending", "approved", "rejected"
       usageCount: Int,           // How many times applied
       successRate: Double,       // Feedback success rate
       createdAt: java.time.Instant,
       updatedAt: Option[java.time.Instant]
   )
   
   enum RuleStatus:
       case Pending, Approved, Rejected
   ```
   
   Rationale: This model captures all necessary metadata to track rule effectiveness and maintain a review workflow.

3. **Phased Implementation**:
   - Phase 1: Basic LLM Integration
   - Phase 2: Rule Generation
   - Phase 3: Feedback Mechanism

   Rationale: Following the MVS approach, we'll start with the simplest implementation that provides value (LLM cleanup) and progressively enhance it.

#### Technical Considerations

1. **OpenAI Integration**:
   - Need to design prompt template that both cleans the payee AND generates rule suggestions
   - Will need to handle rate limiting and caching to control costs
   - Need to process the response to extract both the cleaned name and rule pattern

2. **Rule Matching Algorithm**:
   - Will need to efficiently match incoming transactions against existing rules
   - Need to handle multiple pattern types (exact match, contains, regex)
   - Must track which rule was applied for feedback purposes

3. **Database Schema**:
   - New tables for `payee_cleanup_rules` and `payee_rule_applications`
   - Optimized queries for rule lookup during transaction processing

#### Challenges Identified

1. **Cost Management**: 
   OpenAI API costs could be significant if we process many transactions. Will need to implement caching strategies and efficient rule application to minimize API calls.

2. **Rule Quality**:
   LLM-generated rules might vary in quality. The review process is critical to ensure good rules are approved.

3. **Transaction Context**:
   May need to experiment with how much transaction context to include in prompts for optimal payee identification.

### Next Steps

1. Create the database migration for payee cleanup rules
2. Implement the domain model in the categorization bounded context
3. Create the OpenAI client for LLM integration
4. Implement the basic PayeeCleanupService that uses OpenAI

## Tech Debt & Refactoring Notes

- The current TransactionProcessor has minimal payee cleanup (just uses counterBankName or message). Will need refactoring to integrate with the new PayeeCleanupService.
- Consider extracting common OpenAI client functionality for reuse with categorization later.

## Questions & Research Topics

- What LLM model provides the best balance of cost vs. accuracy for payee cleanup?
- How can we optimize the prompts to generate high-quality rule patterns?
- What transaction context is most useful for payee identification?
