# Development Log: 2025-04-20

## Feature: FIOYNAB-001 (Fio Bank to YNAB Integration)

### Implementation Progress: Self-Learning Payee Cleanup System

Today I started implementing the Self-Learning Payee Cleanup System for the Fio Bank to YNAB Integration project. This is the first step in the MVS (Minimum Viable Solution) as outlined in our Business Value Decomposition document.

#### Completed Work

1. **Created PayeeCleanupRule Domain Model**:
   - Implemented the `PayeeCleanupRule` class with required fields
   - Created supporting enums (`PatternType`, `GeneratorType`, `RuleStatus`)
   - Added factory methods for creating rules from LLM suggestions and human input

2. **Defined PayeeCleanupService Interface**:
   - Created the service interface in the application layer
   - Defined methods for cleaning up payee names
   - Added methods for managing rules (approval workflow, feedback)

3. **Created Database Migration**:
   - Added `V400__payee_cleanup_rules.sql` migration script
   - Created tables for `payee_cleanup_rules` and `payee_rule_applications`
   - Added appropriate indexes and constraints

4. **Repository Design**:
   - Defined `PayeeCleanupRuleRepository` interface following repository pattern
   - Added repository error types
   - Started implementation of PostgreSQL repository

5. **Basic LLM Integration**:
   - Created placeholder `LLMClient` interface
   - Implemented stub `OpenAIPayeeCleanupClient` class
   - Created `LLMPayeeCleanupServiceImpl` implementation

#### Design Decisions

1. **Self-Learning Approach**:
   - Started with the stub implementation that will later be replaced with OpenAI integration
   - Designed the system to start with LLM-based cleanup and transition to rule-based over time

2. **Rule Status Workflow**:
   - Rules generated by LLM start with `Pending` status
   - Human-created rules are auto-approved (status = `Approved`)
   - Added feedback mechanism to track rule performance

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Rules are stored in `payee_cleanup_rules` table
   - Rule applications are tracked in `payee_rule_applications` table
   - Added `success_rate` field to track effectiveness over time

#### Challenges

1. **PostgreSQL Repository Implementation**:
   - Encountered some initial issues with PostgreSQLTransactor access
   - Need to research correct import paths and dependencies

2. **Module Integration**:
   - Need to ensure proper integration with the existing transaction processing pipeline
   - Will need to determine where in the flow the PayeeCleanupService should be called

#### Next Steps

1. **Fix Repository Implementation**:
   - Resolve issues with PostgreSQLTransactor and imports
   - Complete and test the repository implementation

2. **Complete OpenAI Integration**:
   - Implement actual OpenAI client
   - Design proper prompts for payee cleanup and rule generation

3. **TransactionProcessor Integration**:
   - Update TransactionProcessor to use PayeeCleanupService
   - Ensure transaction context is properly passed to the service

4. **Unit Tests**:
   - Add tests for PayeeCleanupService
   - Test rule matching and application logic

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update progress tracking document
   - Document OpenAI prompt design when completed

### Technical Debt Notes

- Need to implement a proper pattern matching algorithm based on rule's patternType in the service implementation
- Current stub LLM client will need to be replaced with real implementation
- Need to add caching for approved rules to improve performance
