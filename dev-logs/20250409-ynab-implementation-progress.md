# YNAB Implementation Progress - 2025-04-09

## Components Implemented

We've made significant progress implementing the YNAB API integration. Here's what we've completed so far:

### 1. YNAB HTTP Client

Created a robust HTTP client that handles communication with the YNAB API:

- Implemented `YnabClient` interface with methods for all required API operations
- Created `YnabClientLive` implementation using sttp for HTTP requests
- Added proper error handling for various HTTP status codes
- Used ZIO layers for dependency injection
- Set up authentication using the API token

### 2. DTOs and JSON Codecs

Created data transfer objects and JSON codecs for mapping between our domain models and the YNAB API format:

- Implemented DTOs for all required API entities
- Added JSON codecs for serialization/deserialization
- Created mapping functions between DTOs and domain models
- Handled YNAB-specific formats (like milliunits for currency amounts)

### 3. YNAB Service Implementation

Implemented the service interfaces with our improved design:

- Created `YnabService` and `YnabBudgetService` interfaces with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented `YnabServiceImpl` that uses the HTTP client
- Created `YnabBudgetServiceImpl` for budget-specific operations
- Set up ZIO layer for dependency injection

### 4. CLI Tool for Testing

Created a CLI tool for testing the API integration:

- Implemented command-line argument parsing
- Added commands for verifying connection, listing budgets/accounts/categories
- Added command for submitting test transactions
- Created pretty-printing functions for displaying results
- Updated to work with our new service design

## Design Evolution

### Initial Design Issues

The initial design had several issues:
- Runtime errors when budget ID wasn't set in the configuration
- Repetitive error-checking code across service methods
- Global mutable state in the configuration (selectedBudgetId)
- Unclear API contract (users had to remember to set the budget ID)

### Improved Design

We implemented a more explicit design with budget-specific services:

```scala
trait YnabService:
    def verifyConnection(): Task[Boolean]
    def getBudgets(): Task[Seq[YnabBudget]]
    def getBudgetService(budgetId: String): YnabBudgetService

trait YnabBudgetService:
    def getAccounts(): Task[Seq[YnabAccount]]
    def getCategoryGroups(): Task[Seq[YnabCategoryGroup]]
    def getCategories(): Task[Seq[YnabCategory]]
    def createTransaction(transaction: YnabTransaction): Task[String]
    def createTransactions(transactions: Seq[YnabTransaction]): Task[Map[YnabTransaction, String]]
```

This approach has several advantages:
- Type safety - compiler enforces budget requirement
- Explicit API contract - the need for a budget is evident in the interface
- Immutability - no global configuration state needs changing
- Composition - services can be created and used independently

### Implementation Benefits

The new design:
1. Provides a cleaner API for consumers
2. Makes it impossible to forget the budget ID requirement
3. Eliminates repetitive error-checking code
4. Follows functional programming principles more closely
5. Makes testing easier with clear dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Write unit tests for the implementation with mocked HTTP responses
2. Create integration tests against a real YNAB test budget
3. Connect the YNAB service to the web application

## Notes

- All implementations follow our architectural principles with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Error handling is built-in throughout the implementation with specific error types
- Component classifications are documented in the code
