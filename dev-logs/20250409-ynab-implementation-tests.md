# YNAB Implementation Tests - 2025-04-09

## Overview

After implementing the YNAB API client, service, and CLI tool, the next step is to add comprehensive testing to ensure the implementation works correctly. In this document, we outline our approach to testing the YNAB integration.

## Testing Approach

We have implemented two types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing the `YnabService` implementation with mocked HTTP responses using sttp's stub backend
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing with a real YNAB test budget (these are optional and run only when configured)

## Implementation Details

### YnabClientSpec

We created a comprehensive test suite for the `YnabClient` class using sttp's `SyncBackendStub` to mock HTTP responses. The test cases include:

- Authentication tests for verifying API tokens
- Tests for retrieving budgets
- Tests for retrieving accounts from a specific budget
- Tests for retrieving categories and category groups
- Tests for creating transactions (single and batch)
- Error handling for various API error scenarios

### YnabServiceSpec

For the service layer, we created a `MockYnabClient` to verify that the service correctly delegates to the client. The test cases include:

- Tests for the global `YnabService` methods (verifyConnection, getBudgets)
- Tests for the budget-specific factory method (getBudgetService)
- Tests for all methods of the budget-specific `YnabBudgetService` implementation
- Verification that the correct budgetId is passed to the client methods

### YnabIntegrationSpec

We also created an optional integration test that can be run with a real YNAB API token and budget ID. This test:

- Only runs when the appropriate environment variables are set
- Tests the full service chain with real API calls
- Includes tests for connecting, retrieving budgets, accounts, and categories
- Tests creating a small test transaction (only 1 cent) to avoid accidental data modification
- Provides detailed output about the data retrieved from YNAB

### Test Resources

To make the tests more readable and maintainable, we added sample JSON responses in the resources directory:

- ynab-sample-budgets.json
- ynab-sample-accounts.json
- ynab-sample-categories.json
- ynab-sample-transaction.json

These files can be used for future reference when modifying the YNAB client implementation.

## Next Steps

With the tests in place, the next logical steps in the YNAB integration are:

1. Implement YNAB account selection in the Source Account UI
2. Add YNAB category synchronization for the AI categorization system
3. Build the transaction submission workflow

These features will connect our existing transaction management UI with the YNAB API, allowing users to import transactions from Fio Bank to YNAB with proper categorization.
