# Development Plan for 2026-03-30

## Goals

1. Complete the end-to-end testing framework for the YNAB Importer
2. Implement and test all Source Account Management scenarios
3. Prepare for YNAB API integration implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Complete E2E Test Framework Configuration (1 hour)

- [ ] Create a proper configuration system for e2e tests
  - [ ] Add environment variable support for test configuration
  - [ ] Create default test configurations for development and CI environments
  - [ ] Add documentation for test configuration options

- [ ] Implement browser installation checks and automation
  - [ ] Add browser validation before test execution
  - [ ] Update README with clear setup instructions 

- [ ] Add screenshot capture on test failures
  - [ ] Implement helper methods to capture screenshots
  - [ ] Configure automatic screenshots when tests fail
  - [ ] Store screenshots in a designated directory with timestamp and test name

### 2. Implement Missing Source Account Management Test Scenarios (2 hours)

- [ ] Complete the "Viewing the list of source accounts" test
  - [ ] Add verification for account details display
  - [ ] Test pagination if applicable

- [ ] Implement "Editing an existing source account" test
  - [ ] Set up test data creation as a prerequisite
  - [ ] Follow the full edit workflow in the test
  - [ ] Verify changes were saved correctly

- [ ] Implement "Deactivate a source account" test
  - [ ] Test the deletion (soft delete) functionality
  - [ ] Verify account appears in inactive accounts list

- [ ] Add test for filtering accounts by status
  - [ ] Test all filter options (active, inactive, all)
  - [ ] Verify correct accounts are displayed for each filter

### 3. Create Test Data Management System (1 hour)

- [ ] Implement test data preparation utilities
  - [ ] Create helper methods to set up test data before tests
  - [ ] Implement cleanup methods to reset data after tests
  - [ ] Add transactions for testing account relationship display

- [ ] Create reusable test fixtures
  - [ ] Standard account fixtures with different states
  - [ ] Account relationship fixtures

### 4. Test Execution and Bug Fixing (2 hours)

- [ ] Run all Source Account Management tests
  - [ ] Identify and fix any UI issues affecting tests
  - [ ] Optimize selectors and waiting strategies
  - [ ] Ensure tests are reliable and don't flake

- [ ] Create a test run script
  - [ ] Add script to run all e2e tests in sequence
  - [ ] Configure reporting of test results

### 5. Prepare for YNAB Integration (2 hours)

- [ ] Research YNAB API requirements
  - [ ] Review API documentation
  - [ ] Identify authentication requirements
  - [ ] List required API endpoints for our integration

- [ ] Design YNAB domain models
  - [ ] Draft initial model classes
  - [ ] Plan service interfaces

- [ ] Set up API testing environment
  - [ ] Create YNAB developer account if needed
  - [ ] Obtain API test credentials
  - [ ] Configure test environment variables

## Success Criteria

- All Source Account Management e2e tests pass reliably
- Test framework is fully configurable and robust
- Test failures provide clear diagnostics (screenshots, logs)
- YNAB API integration plan is ready for implementation
- Initial YNAB domain models are drafted

## Notes

- Start the day by reviewing the current e2e test implementation
- Run tests against a clean environment to ensure consistent results
- Document all test configuration options and requirements
- Prepare technical documentation for the e2e testing framework
- Keep browser automation tests focused on user-facing functionality, not implementation details
