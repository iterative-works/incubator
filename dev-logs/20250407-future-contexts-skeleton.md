# Future Contexts Skeleton Implementation - 2025-04-07

## Overview

As the final phase of our Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture implementation, we've created skeleton structures for future bounded contexts that will be developed in upcoming iterations. This log documents the implementation of these skeleton structures, which serve as placeholders for future functionality while maintaining the architectural consistency established in the earlier phases.

## Changes Made

### AI Categorization Context

We've created the skeleton structure for the AI Categorization Context, which will provide automatic categorization of transactions based on machine learning and rule-based approaches:

1. Package Structure:
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.categorization.domain.model
   works.iterative.incubator.categorization.domain.service
   works.iterative.incubator.categorization.application.service
   ```

2. Domain Models:
   - `CategorySuggestion`: Represents a suggested category for a transaction, including confidence level and explanations
   - `CategoryRule`: Represents a rule for matching transactions to categories based on patterns

3. Application Services:
   - `CategorizationService`: Defines methods for categorizing transactions, managing rules, and training the categorization model

This context will provide AI-powered transaction categorization capabilities, integrating with the Transaction Management Context to enhance the user experience and reduce manual categorization work.

### User Management Context

We've created the skeleton structure for the User Management Context, which will handle authentication, authorization, and user management:

1. Package Structure:
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.auth.domain.model
   works.iterative.incubator.auth.domain.service
   works.iterative.incubator.auth.application.service
   ```

2. Domain Models:
   - `User`: Represents a user in the system with authentication details and assigned roles
   - `Role`: Represents a role with associated permissions
   - `Permission`: Represents a specific permission for a resource and action
   - `CreateUserRequest`: Value object for user creation

3. Application Services:
   - `UserService`: Defines methods for user management, including creation, retrieval, and updates
   - `AuthenticationService`: Defines methods for authentication, token management, and permission checks

This context will provide comprehensive user management capabilities, enabling multi-user support with role-based access control. It will be independent of the Transaction Management Context but will be integrated throughout the application.

## Integration Testing

After creating the skeleton structures for future contexts, we compiled the project to verify that our changes maintain compatibility with the existing codebase. The skeleton interfaces and models don't impact the current functionality and provide a clear direction for future development.

## Future Development Opportunities

These skeleton structures enable several future development opportunities:

1. **AI Categorization Features**:
   - Rule-based categorization for common transaction patterns
   - Machine learning-based categorization for complex cases
   - User feedback loop to improve categorization accuracy over time
   - Category suggestions during transaction import

2. **User Management Features**:
   - Multi-user support with individual accounts
   - Role-based access control for different user types
   - Authentication with tokens for API access
   - Audit logging for security and compliance

## Summary

The implementation of skeleton structures for future contexts completes our DDD architecture restructuring. We've now organized the entire codebase into well-defined bounded contexts with clear responsibilities and interfaces:

1. **Transaction Management Context**: Core functionality for managing financial transactions
2. **YNAB Integration Context**: Integration with the YNAB budgeting service
3. **Fio Bank Context**: Integration with the Fio Bank API for importing transactions
4. **AI Categorization Context**: (Future) Automatic categorization of transactions
5. **User Management Context**: (Future) Authentication, authorization, and user management

Each context follows the same architectural layering:
- **Domain Layer**: Core domain models and logic
- **Application Layer**: Application services and ports for cross-context communication
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical implementations and external integrations
- **Web Layer**: User interface and HTTP endpoints

This consistent structure makes the codebase more maintainable, easier to understand, and better positioned for future extensions. New developers can quickly grasp the overall architecture and locate specific functionality within the appropriate bounded context.
