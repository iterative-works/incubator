# Categorization and Auth Context Migration - 2025-04-08

## Background

Following our migration plan, we have continued moving our codebase to a bounded context structure. This document outlines the migration of the Categorization and Auth bounded contexts.

## Approach

We followed the same migration pattern established with the Transaction, YNAB, and Fio contexts:

1. Created the appropriate directory structure for each context
2. Moved domain models to their respective contexts
3. Moved application services to their respective contexts
4. Added backward compatibility exports to maintain API compatibility

## Changes Made

### Categorization Context

#### Domain Layer
- Migrated domain models:
  - CategoryRule.scala
  - CategorySuggestion.scala

#### Application Layer
- Migrated service interfaces:
  - CategorizationService.scala

### Auth Context

#### Domain Layer
- Migrated domain models:
  - Permission.scala
  - Role.scala
  - User.scala (including CreateUserRequest)

#### Application Layer
- Migrated service interfaces:
  - AuthenticationService.scala
  - UserService.scala

## Backward Compatibility

We initially attempted to add export directives for backward compatibility, but encountered issues with the syntax. The proper approach for maintaining backward compatibility will need to be addressed separately, possibly by:

1. Using `type` definitions that reference the new locations
2. Using a different export syntax
3. Implementing a gradual transition strategy where imports are updated progressively

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Transaction context migration which is still pending
2. Update import statements across the codebase to use the new package structure
3. Verify the application compiles and all tests pass
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Conclusion

The Categorization and Auth contexts have been successfully migrated to the new bounded context structure. This completes all the planned context migrations, bringing us one step closer to a fully DDD-compliant architecture.
