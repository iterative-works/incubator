# E2E Testing Framework Improvements (2026-03-30)

## Overview

Today we focused on implementing a robust end-to-end testing framework for the YNAB Importer application, following the plan outlined in [20260330-plan.md](20260330-plan.md).

## Completed Tasks

1. **TestContainers Framework**
   - Designed and implemented a TestContainers setup that will run:
     - PostgreSQL database in an isolated container
     - Application container connected to the database
   - Added dynamic port mapping and configuration
   - Created ZIO layers for test environment management
   - Set up placeholder implementation until Docker image is available

2. **Screenshot Capture System**
   - Added automatic screenshot capture on test failures
   - Implemented manual screenshot capture during tests
   - Configured screenshot storage with timestamps and test names

3. **Browser Installation and Validation**
   - Rewrote browser installation to use npx playwright install
   - Added validation to check for browser installations
   - Implemented automatic installation if browsers are missing

4. **Configuration System**
   - Enhanced the configuration with TypeSafe Config
   - Added environment variable support for all settings
   - Created sections for Playwright, TestContainers, and screenshots
   - Implemented failsafe defaults for all settings

5. **Test Data Management**
   - Created a TestDataManager with utilities for:
     - Generating random test accounts
     - Creating test transactions
     - Managing predefined test fixtures

## Implementation Details

### TestContainers Setup

The new TestContainers setup creates a Docker network with:
- PostgreSQL container with the application schema
- Application container that connects to the database
- Dynamic port mapping for browser tests

The implementation uses ZIO's resource management to ensure proper cleanup:

```scala
// Create the full test environment with all containers
val createTestEnvironment: ZIO[Scope, Throwable, TestEnvironment] =
  for
    config <- loadConfig
    network <- createNetwork
    pgContainer <- createPostgresContainer(network, config)
    appContainer <- createAppContainer(network, pgContainer, config)
    mappedPort = appContainer.getMappedPort(config.appServerPort)
    baseUrl = new URL(s"http://localhost:$mappedPort")
  yield TestEnvironment(pgContainer, appContainer, baseUrl)
```

### Screenshot Capture

The screenshot support system provides:

```scala
def captureScreenshot(
    page: Page,
    testName: String,
    suffix: String = ""
): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Path]
```

This is used automatically on test failures and can be used manually during test execution.

### E2E Test Structure

Tests now use the `withTestContainers` helper method to automatically manage the test environment:

```scala
test("Creating a new source account") {
  withTestContainers(
    for {
      // Test steps...
    } yield {
      // Assertions...
    }
  )
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Dockerization of the Application**
   - Create a proper Docker image for the application
   - Add a health check endpoint at /health for TestContainers to verify
   - Configure it to connect to the test database
   - Enable the full TestContainers implementation

2. **Complete Test Scenarios**
   - Implement the remaining source account management tests
   - Add test fixture creation as prerequisites
   - Test all filter options and interactions

3. **CI Integration**
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run e2e tests
   - Set up caching for browser binaries
   - Configure test reporting and screenshot capture
   - Use the remote Docker configuration described in [20260330.md](20260330.md)

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Browser Installation**  
   The existing browser installation method was brittle. Replaced with a more robust approach using the npm-based Playwright CLI installation.

2. **Test Environment Setup**  
   Manual test environment setup was error-prone. Automated with TestContainers and proper resource cleanup.

3. **Configuration Management**  
   Making tests work across different environments was challenging. Added a comprehensive configuration system with environment variable support.

4. **Screenshot Management**  
   Screenshots weren't saved consistently. Implemented a proper filesystem-based system with naming and directory management.

These improvements should make the e2e testing framework much more robust and easier to use for developers.
