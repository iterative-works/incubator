# Development Plan: Web Module Pattern Improvements

**Feature References**: 
- [Source Account Management](../ynab-importer/features/source_account_management.feature)
- [Someday/Maybe tasks](TODO.md)

## Summary

We plan to improve our web module pattern to enhance developer experience, code maintainability, and testability. The improvements focus on three main areas:

1. **Replacing routes with Tapir endpoints** - Moving from Http4s route definitions to declarative Tapir endpoints for better type safety and documentation
2. **Adding standalone view debugging with HTML snapshots** - Creating a mechanism to test and debug UI components in isolation
3. **Supporting running single modules as standalone applications** - Allowing developers to work on specific modules independently

This work aligns with the "Someday / Maybe" tasks from our TODO list and will set a foundation for future application development.

## Current State of Web Modules

Currently, our web modules follow a pattern defined by the `ZIOWebModule` trait imported from `works.iterative.server.http`. Each module contains:

- **Service**: ZIO effects for data operations
- **View**: HTML rendering components using ScalaTags
- **Routes**: Http4s routes mapping URLs to services and views

Modules are integrated via `ModuleRegistry` in `src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/server/view/modules/ModuleRegistry.scala`.

Issues with the current approach:
- Routes are defined using Http4s DSL which lacks type safety for request/response bodies
- No clear separation between API and UI routes
- Limited testability for views in isolation
- Inability to run modules independently during development
- Poor documentation for API endpoints

## Improvement Plan

### 1. Replacing Routes with Tapir Endpoints

**Goal**: Improve type safety, documentation, and maintainability of API endpoints

**Implementation Details**:
- Replace `HttpRoutes[WebTask]` with Tapir endpoint definitions
- Separate API endpoints from HTML/UI endpoints
- Leverage Tapir's schema capabilities for automatic validation
- Generate OpenAPI documentation from endpoint definitions
- Use Tapir's ZIO integration for consistent effect handling

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced type safety for request/response handling
- Automatic input validation
- Self-documenting API endpoints
- Clearer separation between API and UI concerns

### 2. Adding Standalone View Debugging with HTML Snapshots

**Goal**: Enable isolated testing and debugging of UI components

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a ViewDebugger utility that renders components to static HTML
- Add support for simulating different states and data scenarios
- Implement HTML snapshot comparison for regression testing
- Create a simple server for viewing components during development
- Add support for component catalogs to showcase UI elements

**Benefits**:
- Faster UI development feedback loop
- Easier visual regression testing
- Better component documentation
- Simplified debugging of complex UI states

### 3. Supporting Single Module Standalone Applications

**Goal**: Allow developers to run and test individual modules independently

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a standalone runner for individual web modules
- Implement environment simulation for required dependencies
- Add configuration for port, environment variables, and mock data
- Create Docker configuration for isolated module testing
- Support hot-reloading for rapid development

**Benefits**:
- Focused development on specific features
- Simplified testing of module interactions
- Reduced startup time during development
- Better separation of concerns

## Implementation Approach

We'll take an incremental approach to these improvements:

1. **Phase 1: Endpoint Migration (1 week)**
   - Create Tapir endpoint definitions for one existing module as a prototype
   - Develop conversion utilities between Http4s and Tapir
   - Update the `ZIOWebModule` trait to support both paradigms
   - Document the new patterns and migration strategy

2. **Phase 2: View Debugging (3-4 days)**
   - Implement the ViewDebugger utility
   - Add HTML snapshot testing capability
   - Create a simple standalone server for component previewing
   - Document usage patterns and examples

3. **Phase 3: Standalone Module Support (3-4 days)**
   - Create the standalone module runner
   - Implement dependency simulation/mocking
   - Add Docker configuration for isolated testing
   - Document the standalone execution process

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Next 2 days)**
   - Create a prototype Tapir endpoint for the SourceAccountModule list view
   - Develop initial ViewDebugger implementation
   - Document the migration strategy for existing modules

2. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Complete Tapir migration for SourceAccountModule
   - Add HTML snapshot tests for key UI components
   - Create proof-of-concept standalone module runner

3. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**
   - Migrate all modules to the new pattern
   - Update documentation and development guidelines
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## E2E Test Status Note

We are leaving the E2E tests in their current state for now. Although they're not fully working, there has been progress, and it makes sense to follow up on them later. First, we'll focus on improving the web module pattern as outlined in this plan.

Throughout the implementation process, we'll maintain backward compatibility to ensure existing functionality remains intact while we improve the underlying architecture.
