# YNAB Context Migration - 2026-04-08

## Background

Following our migration plan, we have started moving our codebase to a bounded context structure. This document outlines the migration of the YNAB bounded context.

## Migration Progress

We have successfully migrated the YNAB bounded context to the new directory structure. The following actions were taken:

1. Created the directory structure for the YNAB bounded context following DDD principles:
   ```
   bounded-contexts/ynab/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/ynab/
     ├── domain/model/        # Domain models
     ├── application/         # Application services and ports
     │   ├── service/
     │   └── port/
     └── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure components
         └── config/
   ```

2. Migrated all domain models:
   - YnabAccount.scala
   - YnabApiError.scala
   - YnabBudget.scala
   - YnabCategory.scala
   - YnabCategoryGroup.scala
   - YnabTransaction.scala
   - YnabTransactionImportResult.scala

3. Migrated application service interfaces and ports:
   - YnabService.scala
   - YnabTransactionImportService.scala
   - YnabTransactionPort.scala

4. Migrated infrastructure configuration:
   - YnabConfig.scala

The original files remain in place with export directives that point to the new locations, ensuring backward compatibility during the migration process.

## Next Steps

1. Implement YnabServiceImpl according to the YNAB integration plan
2. Move the YNAB service implementation to the appropriate location in the bounded context structure
3. Update import statements in dependent files to use the new package structure
4. Add tests for the YNAB bounded context
5. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
