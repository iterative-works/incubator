# Development Plan for 2025-04-01

**Feature References**: 
- [Source Account Management](../ynab-importer/features/source_account_management.feature)
- [YNAB Integration](../ynab-importer/features/ynab_integration.feature)

## Goals

1. Complete end-to-end tests for Source Account Management scenarios
2. Prepare the application for Docker-based testing with TestContainers
3. Begin implementation of YNAB API integration

## Tasks

### 1. Complete Source Account Management E2E Tests (2 hours)

- [ ] Implement "Viewing the list of source accounts" test
  - [ ] Add verification for account details display
  - [ ] Test pagination if applicable

- [ ] Implement "Editing an existing source account" test
  - [ ] Set up test data creation as a prerequisite
  - [ ] Follow the full edit workflow in the test
  - [ ] Verify changes were saved correctly

- [ ] Implement "Deactivate a source account" test
  - [ ] Test the deletion (soft delete) functionality
  - [ ] Verify account appears in inactive accounts list

- [ ] Add test for filtering accounts by status
  - [ ] Test all filter options (active, inactive, all)
  - [ ] Verify correct accounts are displayed for each filter

### 2. Application Dockerization for TestContainers (2 hours)

- [ ] Create a minimal Dockerfile for the application
  - [ ] Select appropriate base image
  - [ ] Configure environment variables
  - [ ] Set up health check endpoints

- [ ] Implement application health endpoint
  - [ ] Add a `/health` endpoint for container readiness checks
  - [ ] Connect health to database connectivity

- [ ] Complete TestContainers application container implementation
  - [ ] Update the `createAppContainer` method to use the actual image
  - [ ] Configure container environment variables for testing
  - [ ] Add wait strategy for application readiness

### 3. Begin YNAB API Integration (3 hours)

- [ ] Create YNAB configuration model
  - [ ] Design model for API token storage
  - [ ] Add configuration loading from environment variables
  - [ ] Create secure storage mechanism for tokens

- [ ] Implement YNAB API client
  - [ ] Create initial client implementation using http4s or sttp
  - [ ] Add authentication headers with token
  - [ ] Implement request/response handling

- [ ] Create YNAB domain models
  - [ ] Design account model matching YNAB structure
  - [ ] Implement category model
  - [ ] Add budget model

- [ ] Design service interfaces
  - [ ] Define YnabService interface
  - [ ] Plan necessary operations for account integration
  - [ ] Document API endpoints to be used

### 4. Test Execution and Bug Fixing (1 hour)

- [ ] Run all Source Account Management tests
  - [ ] Identify and fix any UI issues affecting tests
  - [ ] Optimize selectors and waiting strategies
  - [ ] Ensure tests are reliable and don't flake

- [ ] Create a test run script
  - [ ] Add script to run all e2e tests in sequence
  - [ ] Configure reporting of test results

## Success Criteria

- All Source Account Management e2e tests pass reliably
- Application Docker image works correctly with TestContainers
- YNAB API client implementation can authenticate and fetch accounts
- Initial domain models for YNAB integration are complete

## Notes

- Check the [YNAB Integration Plan](ynab-integration-plan.md) for detailed information on the YNAB API integration
- Consider moving to the [YNAB Integration feature](../ynab-importer/features/ynab_integration.feature) implementation after completing the e2e testing framework
- Document any configuration changes needed for remote Docker testing
