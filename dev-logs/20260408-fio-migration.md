# Fio Context Migration - 2026-04-08

## Background

Following our migration plan, we have started moving our codebase to a bounded context structure. This document outlines the migration of the Fio bounded context.

## Migration Progress

We have successfully migrated the Fio bounded context to the new directory structure. The following actions were taken:

1. Created the directory structure for the Fio bounded context following DDD principles:
   ```
   bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/
     ├── domain/model/        # Domain models
     ├── application/         # Application services and ports
     │   ├── service/
     │   └── port/
     └── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure components
         ├── client/
         ├── config/
         └── service/
   ```

2. Migrated all domain models:
   - FioAccount.scala
   - FioTransaction.scala

3. Migrated application service interfaces and ports:
   - FioImportService.scala
   - TransactionPort.scala

4. Migrated infrastructure components:
   - FioClient.scala
   - FioCodecs.scala
   - FioConfig.scala
   - FioTransactionImportService.scala

The Fio bounded context is now properly structured according to DDD principles, with a clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers. We've maintained the original files to ensure backward compatibility during the migration process.

## Next Steps

1. Create backward compatibility export directives in the original files
2. Update import statements in dependent files to use the new package structure
3. Add tests for the Fio bounded context
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
