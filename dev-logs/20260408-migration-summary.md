# Bounded Context Migration Summary - 2026-04-08

## Overview

We have made significant progress in restructuring our codebase according to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, organizing it by bounded contexts and architectural layers. This document summarizes our migration progress and outlines the next steps.

## Migration Progress

### Transaction Context
- ✅ Domain models migrated to `bounded-contexts/transactions/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/transactions/domain/model/`
- ✅ Query objects migrated to `bounded-contexts/transactions/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/transactions/domain/query/`
- ✅ Repository interfaces migrated to `bounded-contexts/transactions/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/transactions/domain/repository/`
- ✅ Service interfaces migrated to `bounded-contexts/transactions/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/transactions/application/service/`
- ✅ Ports migrated to `bounded-contexts/transactions/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/transactions/application/port/`
- ✅ Infrastructure implementations migrated
- ✅ Web components migrated

### YNAB Context
- ✅ Domain models migrated to `bounded-contexts/ynab/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/ynab/domain/model/`
- ✅ Service interfaces migrated to `bounded-contexts/ynab/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/ynab/application/service/`
- ✅ Ports migrated to `bounded-contexts/ynab/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/ynab/application/port/`
- ✅ Configuration migrated to `bounded-contexts/ynab/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/ynab/infrastructure/config/`
- ❌ Service implementation still needed (YnabServiceImpl)

### Fio Context
- ✅ Domain models migrated to `bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/domain/model/`
- ✅ Service interfaces migrated to `bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/application/service/`
- ✅ Ports migrated to `bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/application/port/`
- ✅ Client implementation migrated to `bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/client/`
- ✅ Service implementation migrated to `bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/service/`
- ✅ Configuration migrated to `bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/config/`

### Categorization & Auth Contexts
- ❌ Migration not yet started

## Build Status

- ✅ Updated build.sbt to define modules for each bounded context
- ✅ Project compiles successfully
- ✅ Unit tests pass successfully
- ❓ E2E tests fail (requires running server)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Missing Implementation**:
   - Implement YnabServiceImpl according to the integration plan

2. **Create Backward Compatibility Exports**:
   - Add export directives to all original files to maintain backward compatibility

3. **Migration of Remaining Contexts**:
   - Migrate Categorization and Auth contexts

4. **Update Import Statements**:
   - Update import statements in all files to use the new package structure

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Run all tests to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Add tests for the new bounded contexts where needed

6. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update architectural documentation to reflect the new structure
   - Document the migration process for future reference

## Insights and Challenges

The migration has progressed smoothly for the Transaction, YNAB, and Fio contexts. The existing code was already well-structured with a clear separation of concerns, making the transition to DDD relatively straightforward.

Some key insights from our migration process:

1. **Code Structure**: Our existing code was already modular, which facilitated the migration process.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Using Scala 3's export directives to maintain backward compatibility has been crucial.
3. **Incremental Approach**: Migrating one bounded context at a time has helped maintain stability during the transition.
4. **Build Structure**: The most challenging aspect was ensuring the build.sbt file correctly defined the module structure.
