# Transaction Context Migration - 2026-04-08

## Background

Following our migration plan, we have continued moving our codebase to a bounded context structure. This document outlines the migration of the Transaction bounded context.

## Approach

We followed the same migration pattern established with our previous context migrations:

1. Created the appropriate directory structure for the Transaction context
2. Moved domain models to their respective location
3. Moved query objects to their respective location
4. Moved repository interfaces to their respective location
5. Moved application services to their respective location
6. Moved ports to their respective location
7. Moved infrastructure implementations to their respective locations
8. Moved web modules and views to their respective locations
9. Added backward compatibility exports to maintain API compatibility

## Changes Made

### Domain Layer
- Migrated domain models:
  - SourceAccount.scala
  - Transaction.scala
  - TransactionId.scala
  - TransactionProcessingState.scala
  - TransactionStatus.scala
- Migrated query objects:
  - SourceAccountQuery.scala
  - TransactionProcessingStateQuery.scala
  - TransactionQuery.scala
- Migrated repository interfaces:
  - SourceAccountRepository.scala
  - TransactionProcessingStateRepository.scala
  - TransactionRepository.scala

### Application Layer
- Migrated service interfaces:
  - TransactionImportService.scala
  - TransactionManagerService.scala
  - TransactionProcessor.scala
- Migrated ports:
  - TransactionPort.scala

### Infrastructure Layer
- Migrated codecs:
  - Codecs.scala
  - DbCodecs.scala
- Migrated service implementations:
  - DefaultTransactionManagerService.scala
  - DefaultTransactionProcessor.scala
  - FlywayMigrationService.scala
- Migrated configuration:
  - PosgreSQLDatabaseModule.scala
  - PostgreSQLConfig.scala
  - PostgreSQLDataSource.scala
  - PostgreSQLTransactor.scala
- Migrated repository implementations:
  - InMemoryTransactionRepository.scala
  - PostgreSQLSourceAccountRepository.scala
  - PostgreSQLTransactionProcessingStateRepository.scala
  - PostgreSQLTransactionRepository.scala

### Web Layer
- Migrated modules:
  - SourceAccountModule.scala
  - TransactionImportModule.scala
- Migrated views:
  - SourceAccountViews.scala
  - SourceAccountViewsImpl.scala
  - TransactionViews.scala
  - TransactionViewsImpl.scala
  - TransactionWithState.scala

## Backward Compatibility

For backward compatibility, we've added export directives in the original locations to reference the new class locations. This approach maintains API compatibility with existing code while we gradually update import statements.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the final steps of the migration plan:
   - Update import statements across the codebase to use the new package structure
   - Determine and implement the correct approach for backward compatibility
   - Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Conclusion

The Transaction context has been successfully migrated to the new bounded context structure. This completes all context migrations, bringing us one step closer to a fully DDD-compliant architecture. The final steps now involve updating import statements and ensuring backward compatibility.
