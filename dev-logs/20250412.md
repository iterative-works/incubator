## Fixing Fio API Authentication Issue in Integration Tests

### Problem Description

We encountered an issue with the Fio Bank API integration tests where the test "Fio client should fetch new transactions using last endpoint" was failing with a 422 error:

```
Exception in thread "zio-fiber-1188" works.iterative.incubator.fio.domain.model.error.FioNetworkError: Network error: Unexpected response from Fio API: 422 - Data není možné poskytnout bez silné autorizace.
```

The error message translates to: "Data cannot be provided without strong authorization."

After investigating the Fio Bank API documentation, we determined that this error occurs because:

1. When using the `/last/` endpoint with a token that has no bookmark ("zarážka") set, the Fio API attempts to retrieve all available transactions from the account's entire history.
2. According to the Fio API documentation (section 3.1), retrieving data older than 90 days requires special authorization in the internet banking interface.
3. This special authorization is not practical to perform during automated testing.

### Solution

We implemented the following solution:

1. Added a `setLastDate` method to the `FioClient` trait and its implementation in `FioClientLive`:
   ```scala
   def setLastDate(token: String, date: LocalDate): Task[Unit]
   ```

2. This method uses the Fio API endpoint `/set-last-date/{token}/{date}/` to set a bookmark ("zarážka") to a specific date.

3. Updated both the direct client test and the import service test to set a bookmark to 90 days ago before attempting to fetch new transactions.

4. With this approach, when the `/last/` endpoint is called, it only attempts to retrieve transactions from the last 90 days, which doesn't require special authorization.

### Additional Implementation: FioAccountService

To solve the problem more systematically for new accounts, we've implemented a new `FioAccountService` that handles creating Fio accounts with an automatic bookmark setting:

1. Created a new application service `FioAccountService` with methods for managing Fio accounts:
   ```scala
   trait FioAccountService:
       def createAccount(sourceAccountId: Long, token: String): Task[Long]
       def getAccount(id: Long): Task[Option[FioAccount]]
       def deleteAccount(id: Long): Task[Unit]
       def setBookmark(accountId: Long, date: LocalDate): Task[Unit]
   ```

2. Implemented `FioAccountServiceLive` which automatically sets a bookmark to 60 days ago when creating a new account:
   ```scala
   override def createAccount(sourceAccountId: Long, token: String): Task[Long] =
       for
           // Create the account in the repository
           encryptedToken <- ZIO.attempt(FioTokenManagerLive.encrypt(token, securityConfig.encryptionKey))
           accountId <- repository.create(CreateFioAccount(sourceAccountId, encryptedToken))
           
           // Set bookmark to 60 days ago to avoid issues with historical data
           _ <- setBookmark(accountId, LocalDate.now.minusDays(60))
               .catchAll(error => 
                   ZIO.logWarning(s"Failed to set initial bookmark: ${error.getMessage}") *>
                   ZIO.unit
               )
       yield accountId
   ```

3. This service ensures that new Fio accounts are created with a bookmark already set, which prevents the 422 error from occurring when importing transactions for the first time.

4. The bookmark is set to 60 days in the past, which provides a good balance between having access to recent transaction history while avoiding the 90-day limitation.

### Implementation Details

1. Added the `setLastDate` method to the `FioClient` trait with appropriate documentation.

2. Implemented the method in `FioClientLive` to make a call to the Fio API's `/set-last-date/` endpoint.

3. Updated the integration tests to set a bookmark date before calling the `/last/` endpoint.

4. Created `FioAccountService` to handle new account creation with automatic bookmark setting.

### Benefits

1. **No Manual Authorization Required**: The tests can now run without requiring manual intervention in the internet banking interface.

2. **More Robust Testing**: We avoid sporadic failures that would occur when attempting to access historical data.

3. **Better User Experience**: New users won't encounter errors when first importing transactions, as their accounts will have bookmarks set automatically.

4. **Better Documentation**: The solution is now documented in both the code and this dev log, making it clear why this approach is necessary.

### Notes for Future Development

- If we need to test retrieval of transactions older than 90 days, we'll need to implement a different approach or handle the authorization requirement differently.
- The setLastDate method could potentially be useful in production code to prevent performance issues when fetching large amounts of historical data.
