# Development: E2E Testing Framework Setup

**Feature References**: 
- [Source Account Management](../ynab-importer/features/source_account_management.feature)

## Project Status

We've recently completed the implementation of the Create pattern for the SourceAccount repository. Today we focused on setting up an end-to-end testing framework using Playwright and ZIO to test our application's UI functionality.

## Problem

While we have unit tests and integration tests, we lack end-to-end tests that validate the application from the user's perspective. Such tests are crucial for ensuring that:

1. UI components render correctly
2. User interactions produce the expected results
3. Different components integrate properly in a real browser environment
4. Features work as specified in our Gherkin feature files

## Solution Approach

Implement an e2e testing framework with the following components:

1. Playwright for browser automation
2. ZIO for effect management and test structure
3. ZIO Test for assertions and test reporting
4. A separation between test support code and actual test implementations

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Project Structure Setup

Created a new module `e2e-tests` within the ynab-importer project:

```scala
lazy val ynabImporterE2ETests = (project in file("ynab-importer/e2e-tests"))
    .settings(name := "ynab-importer-e2e-tests")
    .enablePlugins(IWScalaProjectPlugin)
    .settings(
        commonDependencies,
        // Dependencies for e2e tests
        libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
            "com.microsoft.playwright" % "playwright" % "1.41.0" % Test
        )
    )
    .settings(publish / skip := true)
    .dependsOn(ynabImporterCore, ynabImporterWeb)
```

#### 2. Playwright Support Framework

Created a `PlaywrightSupport` trait that provides ZIO-based wrappers around the Playwright Java API:

```scala
trait PlaywrightSupport {
  // Configuration for Playwright tests
  case class PlaywrightConfig(
      baseUrl: String,
      headless: Boolean,
      // Other configuration parameters...
  )
  
  // ZIO layers for Playwright components
  val playwrightLayer: ZLayer[Any, Throwable, Playwright] = ...
  val browserLayer: ZLayer[PlaywrightConfig & Playwright, Throwable, Browser] = ...
  val pageLayer: ZLayer[Browser & PlaywrightConfig, Throwable, Page] = ...
  
  // Helper methods for common operations
  def waitForUrlContains(urlSubstring: String): ZIO[Page, Throwable, Unit] = ...
  def waitForLoadComplete: ZIO[Page, Throwable, Unit] = ...
  def findElement(selector: String): ZIO[Page, Throwable, ElementHandle] = ...
  def click(selector: String): ZIO[Page, Throwable, Unit] = ...
  // And many more helper methods...
}
```

#### 3. Browser Installation Helper

Created a utility class to install the required Playwright browsers:

```scala
object InstallBrowsers {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Installing Playwright browsers...")
    com.microsoft.playwright.CLI.main(Array("install"))
    println("Browsers installed successfully!")
  }
}
```

#### 4. Initial Test Implementation

Implemented test cases for the Source Account Management feature based on our Gherkin specification:

```scala
object SourceAccountManagementSpec extends ZIOSpecDefault with PlaywrightSupport {
  override def spec = suite("Source Account Management")(
    test("Creating a new source account") {
      withPlaywright(
        for {
          // When I navigate to the source accounts page
          _ <- navigateTo("/source-accounts")
          // And I click on "Add New Account"
          _ <- click("a[href='/source-accounts/new']")
          // Fill in the form and submit...
        } yield assertTrue(...)
      )
    },
    // Other test cases...
  )
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Playwright API Evolution**: The Playwright API had some deprecated methods that needed to be replaced with newer alternatives:
   - Replaced `waitForNavigation` with `waitForURL` and `waitForLoadState`
   - Used scoped imports to avoid unused import warnings

2. **Java/Scala Interoperability**: Added proper conversion between Java collections and Scala collections:
   ```scala
   import scala.jdk.CollectionConverters.*
   elements.asScala.toList
   ```

3. **ZIO Integration**: Created a custom test framework that integrates ZIO effects with Playwright's browser automation:
   - Created ZIO layers for Playwright components
   - Wrapped all Playwright operations in ZIO effects
   - Used ZIO Test for assertions and test structure

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of all test scenarios from the Source Account Management feature
2. Add configuration for running tests in CI environments (headless mode)
3. Enhance error reporting with screenshots on test failures
4. Test additional features as they're implemented (YNAB integration, transaction import, etc.)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for e2e testing in our application, allowing us to verify that features work as expected from the user's perspective.
