# Code Review: FioTokenManager Cache Implementation

## Current implementation review
The current TrieMap implementation provides a thread-safe, concurrent-friendly cache with manual expiration checks. While functional, it has some areas for improvement.

## Recommendations for future enhancement

1. **ZIO-native state management**: Replace TrieMap with ZIO's Ref or RefM to better align with ZIO's functional approach and improve testability.

2. **Proactive cache maintenance**: Implement a background fiber for periodic cache cleanup rather than the current passive expiration check on access.
   ```scala
   private def startCacheCleanupFiber: ZIO[Scope, Nothing, Unit] =
     ZIO.logDebug("Starting token cache cleanup fiber") *>
     ZIO.scheduleForked(
       clearExpiredEntries,
       Schedule.spaced(5.minutes)
     ).unit
   ```

3. **Cache size limits**: Add maximum size constraints to prevent unbounded memory growth.
   ```scala
   private def enforceMaxSize: UIO[Unit] =
     ZIO.when(tokenCache.size > maxCacheSize) {
       // Evict oldest entries
     }
   ```

4. **Improved error handling**: Add better error recovery for cache misses and decryption failures.

5. **Metrics**: Consider adding metrics for cache hit/miss rates, average lookup times, and memory usage.

By implementing these changes, we can enhance reliability, improve memory usage patterns, and better align the implementation with ZIO's functional paradigm.
