# E2E Testing Framework Implementation

We've completed a significant part of the e2e testing framework implementation as planned in the [daily plan](20260330-plan.md). The framework now supports automated browser installation, screenshot capture, and has a design for TestContainers integration.

## Completed Components

### Browser Installation and Validation

Browser installation and validation is now fully automated. When tests run, the system checks if browsers are installed, and if not, downloads and installs them automatically. This makes running e2e tests much simpler, especially for new developers or CI environments.

```scala
def validateBrowserInstallation: Task[Unit] =
    for
        installed <- areBrowsersInstalled
        _ <- if installed 
            then ZIO.logInfo("Playwright browsers are already installed.")
            else ZIO.logWarning("Playwright browsers are not installed, attempting installation...") *>
                installBrowsers.flatMap { result =>
                    if result.installed 
                    then ZIO.logInfo("Playwright browsers installed successfully.")
                    else ZIO.fail(new RuntimeException(s"Failed to install Playwright browsers: ${result.installOutput}"))
                }
    yield ()
```

### Screenshot Capture

We've added a robust screenshot capture system for both automatic failure detection and manual capture:

```scala
def captureScreenshot(
    page: Page,
    testName: String,
    suffix: String = ""
): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Path]
```

Screenshots are saved with timestamps and test names for easy correlation with test failures. In tests, you can also manually capture screenshots at important points:

```scala
// Take a screenshot at any point
_ <- takeScreenshot("form-filled")
```

### TestContainers Design

We've designed the TestContainers integration which will:

1. Create a Docker network
2. Start a PostgreSQL container
3. Start an application container connected to the database
4. Configure test to use the dynamically assigned port

This is implemented but will be fully enabled once we have a Docker image for our application.

### Configuration System

The framework now uses a robust configuration system with:

1. Default values for all settings
2. Configuration through application.conf
3. Environment variable overrides
4. Comprehensive set of options:
   - Browser settings (headless, viewport size, etc)
   - TestContainers settings (image names, ports, etc)
   - Screenshot settings (directory, capture behavior)

This makes the framework highly configurable for different environments while maintaining sensible defaults.

## Next Steps

1. Create a Docker image for the application with health check endpoint
2. Complete implementation of Source Account Management e2e tests
3. Configure CI to run the e2e tests as part of our pipeline
