# Transaction Context Restructuring - 2026-04-05

## Overview

As part of our ongoing effort to implement a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, we're restructuring the codebase to organize it by bounded contexts and architectural layers. This log documents the implementation of the preparations for the Transaction Management Context restructuring.

## Changes Made

### Package Structure Creation

We've created the package structure for the Transaction Management Context following DDD principles:

1. Domain Layer (core module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.domain.model
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.domain.repository
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.domain.query
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.domain.service
   ```

2. Application Layer (core module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.application.service
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.application.port
   ```

3. Infrastructure Layer (infrastructure module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.infrastructure.persistence
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.infrastructure.adapter
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.infrastructure.config
   ```

4. User Interface Layer (web module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.web.view
   works.iterative.incubator.transactions.web.module
   ```

This structure follows DDD architectural principles:
- **Domain Layer**: Contains core domain models, repositories, and domain services
- **Application Layer**: Contains application services and ports for cross-context communication
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains persistence implementations, external adapters, and configuration
- **User Interface Layer**: Contains views and web modules for the UI

### Task Progress

We've completed the preparation tasks (1.1-1.3) in the migration task list:
- Created the domain layer package structure
- Created the application layer package structure
- Created the infrastructure layer package structure
- Created the user interface layer package structure

## Domain Model Migration

We've completed the Domain Model Migration tasks (1.4-1.8), which involved:

1. Moving domain model classes to their proper packages:
   - `Transaction.scala` → `transactions.domain.model`
   - `TransactionId.scala` → `transactions.domain.model`
   - `TransactionStatus.scala` → `transactions.domain.model`
   - `SourceAccount.scala` → `transactions.domain.model`
   - `TransactionProcessingState.scala` → `transactions.domain.model`

2. Adding classification comments to each domain model to indicate its role:
   - `Transaction` - Domain Entity (Value Object)
   - `TransactionId` - Domain Value Object
   - `TransactionStatus` - Domain Enumeration (Value Object)
   - `SourceAccount` - Domain Entity
   - `CreateSourceAccount` - Domain Value Object (Command)
   - `TransactionProcessingState` - Domain Entity

3. Creating backward compatibility facades in the original package locations to maintain compatibility with existing code. These facades use the Scala 3 `export` feature to re-export the types from their new locations.

4. Moving repository implementations to their new packages:
   - `PostgreSQLTransactionRepository.scala` → `transactions.infrastructure.persistence`
   - `PostgreSQLSourceAccountRepository.scala` → `transactions.infrastructure.persistence`
   - Updated import statements to reference domain models in their new package locations

This approach allows us to maintain compatibility with existing code while transitioning to the new DDD-aligned package structure.

## Domain Query Migration

We've completed the Domain Query Migration tasks (1.9-1.11), which involved:

1. Moving query classes to their proper packages:
   - `TransactionQuery.scala` → `transactions.domain.query`
   - `SourceAccountQuery.scala` → `transactions.domain.query`
   - `TransactionProcessingStateQuery.scala` → `transactions.domain.query`

2. Adding classification comments to each query class to indicate its role:
   - `TransactionQuery` - Domain Query Object
   - `SourceAccountQuery` - Domain Query Object
   - `TransactionProcessingStateQuery` - Domain Query Object

3. Creating backward compatibility facades for each query class to maintain compatibility with existing code.

## Domain Repository Interface Migration

We've also completed the Domain Repository Interface Migration tasks (1.12-1.14), which involved:

1. Moving repository interfaces to their proper packages:
   - `TransactionRepository.scala` → `transactions.domain.repository`
   - `SourceAccountRepository.scala` → `transactions.domain.repository`
   - `TransactionProcessingStateRepository.scala` → `transactions.domain.repository`

2. Adding classification comments to each repository interface to indicate its role:
   - `TransactionRepository` - Domain Repository Interface
   - `SourceAccountRepository` - Domain Repository Interface
   - `TransactionProcessingStateRepository` - Domain Repository Interface

3. Creating backward compatibility facades for each repository interface.

4. Updating references in the infrastructure layer to point to the new repository locations.

## Next Steps

The next tasks in the migration plan are:

1. **Application Service Migration** (Tasks 1.15-1.17):
   - Move service interfaces to the application.service package
   - Add classification comments

2. **Fix Compilation Issues**:
   - Resolve remaining issues with imports and type references
   - Ensure the application compiles cleanly

3. **Infrastructure Service Implementation Migration** (Tasks 1.22-1.23):
   - Move service implementations to the infrastructure.service package
   - Update import statements as needed

Each file will be moved to its appropriate package following the DDD architecture pattern while maintaining backward compatibility through carefully planned refactoring.
