# Development Log: 2025-04-18

## Feature: FIOYNAB-001 (Fio Bank to YNAB Integration)

### Planning and Design

Today's work focused on planning and designing the Self-Learning Payee Cleanup System, which is the critical component identified in our Business Value Decomposition. This component will significantly improve the data quality of payee information before it's sent to YNAB.

#### Design Decisions

1. **Self-Learning Approach**:
   Instead of a traditional rule-based system, we've designed a self-learning system that:
   - Uses LLM to clean payee names AND generate rule patterns
   - Starts with no predefined rules and builds them over time
   - Includes a review workflow for suggested rules
   - Tracks rule performance metrics to continuously improve

   Rationale: This approach gives us immediate value through LLM-based cleanup while reducing API costs over time as rules are established. It also maintains human oversight while automating the improvement process.

2. **Rule Model Design**:
   ```scala
   case class PayeeCleanupRule(
       id: String,
       pattern: String,           // The pattern to match
       patternType: String,       // Type of pattern: "exact", "contains", "regex"
       replacement: String,       // The cleaned payee name
       confidence: Double,        // Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
       generatedBy: String,       // "llm" or "human"
       status: RuleStatus,        // "pending", "approved", "rejected"
       usageCount: Int,           // How many times applied
       successRate: Double,       // Feedback success rate
       createdAt: java.time.Instant,
       updatedAt: Option[java.time.Instant]
   )

   enum RuleStatus:
       case Pending, Approved, Rejected
   ```

   Rationale: This model captures all necessary metadata to track rule effectiveness and maintain a review workflow.

3. **Phased Implementation**:
   - Phase 1: Basic LLM Integration
   - Phase 2: Rule Generation
   - Phase 3: Feedback Mechanism

   Rationale: Following the MVS approach, we'll start with the simplest implementation that provides value (LLM cleanup) and progressively enhance it.

#### Technical Considerations

1. **OpenAI Integration**:
   - Need to design prompt template that both cleans the payee AND generates rule suggestions
   - Will need to handle rate limiting and caching to control costs
   - Need to process the response to extract both the cleaned name and rule pattern

2. **Rule Matching Algorithm**:
   - Will need to efficiently match incoming transactions against existing rules
   - Need to handle multiple pattern types (exact match, contains, regex)
   - Must track which rule was applied for feedback purposes

3. **Database Schema**:
   - New tables for `payee_cleanup_rules` and `payee_rule_applications`
   - Optimized queries for rule lookup during transaction processing

#### Challenges Identified

1. **Cost Management**:
   OpenAI API costs could be significant if we process many transactions. Will need to implement caching strategies and efficient rule application to minimize API calls.

2. **Rule Quality**:
   LLM-generated rules might vary in quality. The review process is critical to ensure good rules are approved.

3. **Transaction Context**:
   May need to experiment with how much transaction context to include in prompts for optimal payee identification.

### Initial Implementation

After completing the planning phase, I began implementing the foundation of the system:

1. **Created PayeeCleanupRule Domain Model**:
   - Implemented the `PayeeCleanupRule` class with required fields
   - Created supporting enums (`PatternType`, `GeneratorType`, `RuleStatus`)
   - Added factory methods for creating rules from LLM suggestions and human input

2. **Created Database Migration**:
   - Added `V400__payee_cleanup_rules.sql` migration script
   - Created tables for `payee_cleanup_rules` and `payee_rule_applications`
   - Added appropriate indexes and constraints

The domain model implements the design proposed earlier, but with proper enums instead of string fields:

```scala
case class PayeeCleanupRule(
    id: String,                       // Unique identifier for the rule
    pattern: String,                  // Pattern to match against raw payee names
    patternType: PatternType,         // Type of pattern (exact, contains, regex)
    replacement: String,              // The cleaned payee name to use
    
    confidence: Double,               // Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
    generatedBy: GeneratorType,       // How this rule was generated
    status: RuleStatus,               // Current status (pending, approved, rejected)
    
    usageCount: Int,                  // How many times rule has been applied
    successRate: Double,              // Success rate based on feedback (0.0 to 1.0)
    
    createdAt: Instant,               // When this rule was created
    updatedAt: Option[Instant]        // When this rule was last updated
)

enum PatternType:
    case Exact       // Exact string match
    case Contains    // String contains pattern
    case StartsWith  // String starts with pattern
    case Regex       // Regular expression pattern

enum GeneratorType:
    case LLM     // Generated by LLM
    case Human   // Created by human user

enum RuleStatus:
    case Pending    // Newly created, awaiting review
    case Approved   // Reviewed and approved
    case Rejected   // Reviewed and rejected
```

The database schema follows the domain model with appropriate indexes and constraints for efficient rule lookup and application tracking.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Today

#### 1. Created Domain Model (Morning)
Created the `PayeeCleanupRule` domain model with supporting types and factory methods as described earlier.

#### 2. Created Database Migration (Afternoon)
Added the `V400__payee_cleanup_rules.sql` migration script with tables for rules and rule applications.

#### 3. Created PayeeCleanupService Interface (Late Afternoon)
Designed and implemented the service interface for payee cleanup:

```scala
trait PayeeCleanupService:
    /** Clean up a payee name using existing rules or LLM generation */
    def cleanupPayee(
        original: String, 
        context: Map[String, String]
    ): Task[PayeeCleanupResult]
    
    /** Get all rules with pending status that need approval */
    def getPendingRules(): Task[Seq[PayeeCleanupRule]]
    
    /** Get all approved rules */
    def getApprovedRules(): Task[Seq[PayeeCleanupRule]]
    
    /** Approve a pending rule, optionally with modifications */
    def approveRule(
        ruleId: String, 
        modifications: Option[Map[String, String]] = None
    ): Task[PayeeCleanupRule]
    
    /** Reject a pending rule */
    def rejectRule(
        ruleId: String, 
        reason: Option[String] = None
    ): Task[Unit]
    
    /** Provide feedback on rule application */
    def provideFeedback(
        ruleId: String, 
        wasSuccessful: Boolean
    ): Task[Unit]
    
    /** Find rules that match a given payee name */
    def findMatchingRules(
        payeeName: String
    ): Task[Seq[PayeeCleanupRule]]
    
    /** Create a new rule manually (by a human) */
    def createRule(
        pattern: String,
        patternType: PatternType,
        replacement: String
    ): Task[PayeeCleanupRule]
```

The interface includes all functionality needed for:
- Cleaning up payee names (main use case)
- Managing rules (pending â†’ approved/rejected workflow)
- Collecting feedback on rule performance
- Finding and creating rules

Also created a `PayeeCleanupResult` case class to represent the complete result of a cleanup operation:

```scala
case class PayeeCleanupResult(
    original: String,         // Original payee name
    cleaned: String,          // Cleaned payee name
    confidence: Double,       // Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
    appliedRule: Option[PayeeCleanupRule],   // Existing rule that was applied (if any)
    generatedRule: Option[PayeeCleanupRule]  // New rule that was generated (if any)
)
```

This allows capturing both the cleaned name and any rules that were applied or generated during the process, which is more comprehensive than the original tuple return type.

## Updated Next Steps

1. Implement the OpenAI client for LLM integration
2. Create the PostgreSQL repository for rule storage and retrieval
3. Implement the LLMPayeeCleanupServiceImpl
4. Update the transaction processor to use the PayeeCleanupService

## Tech Debt & Refactoring Notes

- The current TransactionProcessor has minimal payee cleanup (just uses counterBankName or message). Will need refactoring to integrate with the new PayeeCleanupService.
- Consider extracting common OpenAI client functionality for reuse with categorization later.

## Questions & Research Topics

- What LLM model provides the best balance of cost vs. accuracy for payee cleanup?
- How can we optimize the prompts to generate high-quality rule patterns?
- What transaction context is most useful for payee identification?
