# Development Log for 2025-03-31: E2E Testing Framework and Docker Configuration

**Feature References**: 
- [Source Account Management](../ynab-importer/features/source_account_management.feature)
- [End-to-end testing for Source Account Management](/ynab-importer/e2e-tests)

## Overview

Today we continued work on the end-to-end testing framework, focusing on resolving issues with the TestContainers setup and improving the Docker configuration to allow for both local and CI testing.

## Completed Tasks

1. **TestContainers Dependencies**
   - Added TestContainers dependencies to the build.sbt file
   - Configured TestContainers logging with logback
   - Added container lifecycle management to properly clean up resources

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Researched options for CI integration with TestContainers
   - Added support for remote Docker daemon connections
   - Documented configuration for TLS certificates and authentication

3. **Browser Management**
   - Fixed issues with browser installation checking
   - Added proper error handling for browser installation failures
   - Ensured browser binaries are correctly detected across environments

## Implementation Details

### TestContainers Dependencies

Added the following dependencies to the build.sbt file:

```scala
val testContainersVersion = "1.19.4"
val testContainersDeps = Seq(
  "org.testcontainers" % "testcontainers" % testContainersVersion,
  "org.testcontainers" % "postgresql" % testContainersVersion,
  "org.testcontainers" % "jdbc" % testContainersVersion,
  "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.4.14"
)
```

### Remote Docker Configuration

Identified and documented the required configuration for connecting TestContainers to a remote Docker daemon:

1. Environment Variables Approach:
```bash
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://193.86.200.14:2376
DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/certs
```

2. Properties File Approach (`~/.testcontainers.properties`):
```properties
testcontainers.docker.host=tcp://193.86.200.14:2376
testcontainers.docker.tls.verify=true
testcontainers.docker.cert.path=/path/to/certs
```

### Browser Installation Validation

The browser installation validation now properly checks for the installed browsers and attempts to install them if they're missing:

```scala
def areBrowsersInstalled: Task[Boolean] = 
  ZIO.attemptBlocking {
    val process = new ProcessBuilder("npx", "playwright", "install", "--dry-run")
      .redirectError(ProcessBuilder.Redirect.PIPE)
      .start()
    
    val exitCode = process.waitFor()
    exitCode == 0
  }
```

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **TestContainers Configuration**  
   TestContainers has specific requirements for Docker daemon connections that don't align with Docker CLI contexts. Created detailed documentation on the required configuration.

2. **CI Integration**  
   CI environments may not have direct access to Docker. Implemented and documented remote Docker daemon connectivity.

3. **Testing Environment Management**  
   Ensuring test environments are cleaned up was challenging. Implemented proper ZIO resource management for cleanup.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Source Account UI Tests**
   - Implement the "Viewing the list of source accounts" test
   - Create the "Editing an existing source account" test
   - Implement the "Deactivate a source account" test
   - Add tests for filtering accounts by status

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Finalize the test data preparation utilities
   - Create comprehensive test fixtures for various scenarios

3. **CI Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for e2e tests
   - Configure Docker service for CI execution
   - Implement caching for browser binaries
