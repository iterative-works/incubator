# Fio Bank Integration Implementation Progress - 2025-04-09

## Implementation Progress

Based on our implementation plan from earlier today, we have made significant progress on the Fio Bank integration.

### Completed

#### 1. Test Infrastructure

- [x] Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/test/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/client/FioCodecsSpec.scala`
  - Added tests for JSON parsing of example Fio API responses
  - Included assertions for various transaction fields and types

- [x] Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/test/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/client/FioClientSpec.scala`
  - Added tests for client methods with stubbed HTTP responses
  - Created tests for error handling for different API response codes
  - Included tests for URL construction for different API endpoints

- [x] Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/test/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/service/FioTransactionImportServiceSpec.scala`
  - Added tests for mapping from Fio transactions to domain model
  - Created tests for source account resolution logic
  - Implemented tests for transaction saving logic

#### 2. Core Functionality Completion

- [x] Implemented last transaction ID tracking:
  - Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/domain/model/FioImportState.scala`
  - Defined FioImportStateRepository interface
  - Added methods to track the last imported transaction ID

- [x] Implemented repositories:
  - Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/persistence/InMemoryFioImportStateRepository.scala`
  - Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/infrastructure/persistence/PostgreSQLFioImportStateRepository.scala` (simplified version for now)
  - Updated FioTransactionImportService to use the import state repository

- [x] Enhanced error handling:
  - Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/domain/model/error/FioApiError.scala`
  - Defined specific error types for different Fio API errors
  - Updated FioClient to use the new error types
  - Added proper error messages and improved error handling

#### 3. CLI Tool for Testing

- [x] Created a CLI tool for Fio integration testing:
  - Created `/bounded-contexts/fio/src/main/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/cli/FioCliMain.scala`
  - Implemented commands for importing transactions and listing accounts
  - Added support for configuration from environment variables

### In Progress

#### 1. CLI Tool for Testing
- [ ] Fix compilation issues with SourceAccountRepository compatibility
- [ ] Fix runtime dependency issues with PostgreSQLTransactor

### Pending

#### 1. Integration Tests

- [ ] Create `/bounded-contexts/fio/it/src/test/scala/works/iterative/incubator/fio/FioIntegrationSpec.scala`
  - Conditionally run tests when Fio API credentials are available
  - Test real API communication
  - Test full import workflow

#### 2. Account Management

- [ ] Implement FioAccountRepository interface and implementation
- [ ] Add methods to FioImportService for managing Fio accounts
- [ ] Implement validation for Fio API tokens

#### 3. Web UI Components (Low Priority)

- [ ] Create web module for Fio integration
- [ ] Create views for account management and transaction import
- [ ] Integrate with existing UI components

## Implementation Challenges

During the implementation, we've encountered several challenges:

1. **Repository Interface Compatibility**: 
   - The SourceAccountRepository interface has evolved since the original implementation
   - It now extends from core service interfaces that require additional methods and different return types
   - Need to refactor the mock implementations to match the current interface

2. **PostgreSQL Integration**:
   - The PostgreSQL implementation requires doobie dependencies
   - We need to ensure these are properly added to the build.sbt file
   - For now, we've created simplified mock implementations that work in-memory

3. **Service Dependencies**:
   - The FioTransactionImportService has dependencies on repositories from the transactions bounded context
   - This creates a cross-context dependency that needs careful handling

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining compilation issues in the CLI tool:
   - Create proper mock implementations of SourceAccountRepository
   - Ensure all interfaces match their expected contracts

2. Create integration tests that can be run conditionally when Fio credentials are available

3. Implement the full PostgreSQL repository implementation with proper doobie dependencies

4. Implement account management functionality

5. Test the CLI tool with real Fio API credentials

## Summary

We have made excellent progress on the Fio Bank integration, establishing:

1. Comprehensive test suite for the client and service components
2. Improved error handling with domain-specific error types
3. Transaction ID tracking for incremental imports
4. Command-line interface for testing (in progress)

The implementation follows our DDD architecture principles with clean separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers. The next steps will focus on resolving the compatibility issues and completing the integration tests.
