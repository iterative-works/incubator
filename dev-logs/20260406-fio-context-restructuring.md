# Fio Bank Context Restructuring - 2026-04-06

## Overview

As part of our ongoing effort to implement a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, we're continuing the codebase restructuring to organize it by bounded contexts and architectural layers. This log documents the implementation of the Fio Bank Context restructuring, which follows the successful completion of the Transaction Management Context and YNAB Integration Context restructurings.

## Changes Made

### Package Structure Creation

We've created the package structure for the Fio Bank Context following DDD principles:

1. Domain Layer (core module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.domain.model
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.domain.service
   ```

2. Application Layer (core module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.application.service
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.application.port
   ```

3. Infrastructure Layer (infrastructure module):
   ```
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.infrastructure.client
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.infrastructure.config
   works.iterative.incubator.fio.infrastructure.service
   ```

This structure follows DDD architectural principles:
- **Domain Layer**: Contains core domain models and domain services specific to Fio Bank integration
- **Application Layer**: Contains application services and ports for cross-context communication
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains client implementation, configurations, and service implementations for Fio Bank API integration

### Domain Model Migration

We've successfully completed the Domain Model Migration tasks (3.2-3.3):

1. Moved `FioTransaction.scala` to `fio.domain.model` and added classification comments:
   - Classified `FioTransaction` as a Domain Entity (External API Model)
   - Classified `FioTransactionValue` as a Domain Value Object
   - Classified `FioTransactionList`, `FioStatementInfo`, `FioAccountStatement`, and `FioResponse` as Domain Value Objects
   - Created backward compatibility facade for these types

2. Created `FioAccount.scala` in `fio.domain.model` with the following entities:
   - `FioAccount`: Domain Entity representing a Fio Bank account with its API token
   - `CreateFioAccount`: Domain Value Object (Command) for creating new Fio accounts

These classes represent the core domain concepts in the Fio Bank context and are independent of any infrastructure or application concerns.

### Application Layer Implementation

We've successfully completed the Application Service task (3.4):

1. Created `FioImportService.scala` interface in `fio.application.service`:
   - Defined application service interface for importing transactions from Fio Bank API
   - Added methods for date-range based import and "new transactions" import
   - Added method to get available Fio Bank accounts

2. Created `TransactionPort.scala` in `fio.application.port`:
   - Defined port interface for interacting with the Transaction Management Context
   - Added methods for saving transactions and resolving source account IDs
   - This port maintains a clear separation between the Fio Bank and Transaction Management contexts

These interfaces define the application-level operations and cross-context boundaries in our DDD architecture.

### Infrastructure Implementation

We've successfully completed the Infrastructure Migration tasks (3.5-3.8):

1. Moved `FioClient.scala` to `fio.infrastructure.client` and added classification comments:
   - Classified `FioClient` as an Infrastructure Client interface
   - Classified `FioClientLive` as an Infrastructure Client Implementation
   - Updated imports to reference domain models in their new locations
   - Created backward compatibility facade

2. Moved `FioConfig.scala` to `fio.infrastructure.config` and added classification comments:
   - Classified `FioConfig` as Infrastructure Configuration
   - Created backward compatibility facade

3. Moved `FioCodecs.scala` to `fio.infrastructure.client` and added classification comments:
   - Classified `FioCodecs` as Infrastructure Client Support
   - Updated imports to reference domain models in their new locations
   - Created backward compatibility facade

4. Moved `FioTransactionImportService.scala` to `fio.infrastructure.service` and added classification comments:
   - Classified `FioTransactionImportService` as Infrastructure Service Implementation
   - Enhanced implementation to handle both service interfaces (TransactionImportService and FioImportService)
   - Fixed ZIO layer definition to properly support both service interfaces
   - Created backward compatibility facade

These implementations handle the technical details of communication with the Fio Bank API, parsing JSON responses, and converting to domain models.

### Integration Testing

After moving all the files, we successfully compiled the project to verify that our changes maintain backward compatibility. The use of Scala 3's export feature ensures that existing code can continue to reference the old package structure while we gradually migrate to the new DDD-aligned structure.

## Summary

The Fio Bank Context restructuring has been successfully completed, with the following accomplishments:

1. Created a clean DDD-aligned package structure for the Fio Bank Context
2. Moved domain models to their appropriate packages
3. Created application service interfaces and port definitions
4. Moved infrastructure implementations to their appropriate packages
5. Added classification comments to clarify the architectural role of each component
6. Created backward compatibility facades to maintain compatibility with existing code
7. Successfully compiled the project to verify that the migration doesn't break functionality

This restructuring improves our code organization by clearly separating the Fio Bank Context from other contexts, following Domain-Driven Design principles. The clear layering within the context (domain, application, infrastructure) makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

Next steps will be to implement the skeleton structures for Future Contexts (Phase 4), including AI Categorization Context and User Management Context.
