# Architecture Restructuring Implementation Steps

## Context

Today we have developed a comprehensive plan for restructuring our codebase according to Domain-Driven Design principles, with a focus on organizing by bounded contexts and architectural layers. The plan includes the following documents:

1. [Package Structure Design Document](202520250405-package-structure-design.md)
2. [Migration Task List](202520250405-migration-task-list.md)
3. [Component Classification Examples](202520250405-component-classification-examples.md)
4. [Cross-Context Communication Patterns](202520250405-cross-context-communication.md)

## Implementation Sequence

We will implement the restructuring in the following sequential steps:

### Step 1: Package Reorganization
Follow the [migration task list](202520250405-migration-task-list.md) to physically move files into their new package structure according to bounded contexts and architectural layers. This will be done incrementally by context:
- Transaction Management Context
- YNAB Integration Context
- Fio Bank Context
- Future contexts (skeleton only)

During this step, we'll focus on maintaining functionality while reorganizing the code. After each major refactoring, we'll compile and run tests to ensure everything still works as expected.

### Step 2: Component Classification
Once the package structure is in place, we'll review each file and add appropriate classification comments based on the [component classification examples](202520250405-component-classification-examples.md). During this process, we will:
- Add classification comments to each file
- Identify components that don't cleanly fit into a classification
- Document components that need further refactoring to align with their intended role

### Step 3: Context Communication Refactoring
With the package structure and classifications in place, we'll implement the cross-context communication patterns defined in the [cross-context communication document](202520250405-cross-context-communication.md). This includes:
- Defining and implementing ports between contexts
- Setting up domain events for loose coupling
- Creating anti-corruption layers where needed
- Reviewing and refining context boundaries

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:
1. All code is organized according to the planned package structure
2. All components have appropriate classification comments
3. Cross-context communication follows the defined patterns
4. All tests pass
5. The application functions as expected from an end-user perspective

## Next Steps

After completing the implementation, we'll:
1. Update project documentation to reflect the new architecture
2. Create visual diagrams of the bounded contexts and their relationships
3. Update onboarding docs for new developers to understand the architecture
4. Review the implementation for any remaining architectural debt
