# Change Request: CR-2025001

## Change Request Overview
- **Title**: Fio Bank to YNAB Data Import and Categorization Tool
- **Requested By**: Michal Příhoda
- **Date Requested**: 2025-03-06
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: New Feature
- **Target Release**: 2025-04-15

## Business Case
### Problem Statement
IW Incubator needs a tool to automate the process of importing financial transaction data from Fio Bank to the YNAB (You Need A Budget) application. The current manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks consistency in transaction categorization.

### Business Impact
- **Current Situation**: Transactions must be manually exported from Fio Bank and imported into YNAB, with manual categorization of each transaction, consuming significant administrative time and creating delays in financial reporting.
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - Reduction in manual data entry time by approximately 80%
  - Increased accuracy of transaction categorization using AI
  - More timely financial data in YNAB leading to improved budgeting decisions
  - Streamlined workflow with ability to review and modify categorizations before submission
- **Impact of Not Implementing**:
  - Continued resource waste on manual data processing
  - Potential for human error in transaction categorization
  - Delays in financial reporting and budget management

### Success Metrics
- **Time Spent on Transaction Management**: 3 hours/week → 30 minutes/week
- **Categorization Accuracy**: 65% (manual) → 80%+ (AI-assisted)
- **Financial Reporting Delay**: 3-5 days → Same-day updates

## Change Description
### Proposed Change
Develop a web-based tool that automates the process of retrieving transaction data from Fio Bank API, storing it in a PostgreSQL database, using AI to categorize transactions, allowing user review and modification of categorizations, and submitting the processed transactions to YNAB through their API.

### Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Fio Bank API integration for transaction retrieval
  - PostgreSQL database implementation for transaction storage
  - AI-powered transaction categorization system using OpenAI API
  - Web interface for transaction management and review
  - YNAB API integration for submitting processed transactions
  - Admin authentication for system access
  - Manual triggering of import process
  - Transaction status tracking (imported, categorized, submitted)
  - Duplicate transaction prevention

- **Out of Scope**:
  - Support for financial institutions other than Fio Bank
  - Integration with budgeting tools other than YNAB
  - Mobile application development
  - Automated scheduling of imports
  - Advanced historical data analysis
  - Modification of YNAB budget settings or categories
  - Multi-user access with different permission levels

### Affected Components
- New backend service (Python/FastAPI)
- New frontend application (React/Material UI)
- New PostgreSQL database
- Integration with Fio Bank API (external)
- Integration with YNAB API (external)
- Integration with OpenAI API (external)

### Dependencies
- Access to Fio Bank API credentials
- Access to YNAB API credentials
- OpenAI API access
- Hosting environment for web application and database

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: The system shall authenticate with Fio Bank API and retrieve transaction data
- **FR2**: The system shall store transactions in a PostgreSQL database with appropriate schema
- **FR3**: The system shall use AI to categorize transactions before submission to YNAB
- **FR4**: The system shall display all transactions with their current status in a web interface
- **FR5**: The system shall allow users to view, filter, and sort transactions by various attributes
- **FR6**: The system shall enable manual editing of AI-assigned categories before submission
- **FR7**: The system shall authenticate with YNAB API and submit transactions
- **FR8**: The system shall maintain transaction history and prevent duplicate submissions
- **FR9**: The system shall support admin authentication for access control

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: The AI categorization system shall achieve at least 80% accuracy for common transaction types
- **NFR2**: The web interface shall be responsive and function on standard desktop browsers
- **NFR3**: The system shall process and categorize transactions within 1 minute of import
- **NFR4**: The database shall be able to store at least 2 years of transaction history
- **NFR5**: The system shall ensure secure handling of financial data with appropriate encryption

### Constraints
- Development must be completed by April 5, 2025
- System must be deployed to production by April 15, 2025
- Development effort limited to 15 person-days
- Solution must comply with financial data handling regulations

## Stakeholder Analysis
| Stakeholder | Interest | Impact | Communication Needs |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Finance Team | Accurate and timely financial data in YNAB | High | Weekly updates on progress, training on new system |
| IT Operations | System deployment and maintenance | Medium | Technical documentation, deployment procedures |
| Management | Improved efficiency and accuracy in financial reporting | High | Executive summary of benefits, ROI analysis |
| End Users | Simplified workflow for financial data management | High | User guides, training sessions |

## Initial Assessment
### Technical Feasibility
The proposed change is technically feasible. All required APIs (Fio Bank, YNAB, OpenAI) are available and well-documented. The proposed architecture using Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and React is appropriate for the requirements and aligned with the team's technical capabilities.

### Resource Requirements
- **Estimated Effort**: 15 person-days
- **Required Skills**: Python development, API integration, database design, AI/ML (for prompt engineering), React frontend development
- **Required Tools/Infrastructure**: Development environment, CI/CD pipeline, production hosting for web application and database

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**:
  - Fio Bank or YNAB API changes could impact integration
  - AI categorization accuracy may not meet the 80% target initially
  - Data synchronization issues may occur between systems
- **Business Risks**:
  - Dependency on third-party APIs creates potential points of failure
  - Financial data security concerns require careful implementation
  - User adoption might be slow if interface is not intuitive

## Approval
