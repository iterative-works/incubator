# Foundational Principles

    1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with [Functional Core](craftdocs://open?blockId=E9CEA6CA-E4FC-498E-92DB-F8FDB7C79027&spaceId=3945ab4f-8178-1203-fdd5-770b7e4eab77) Architecture**
        - Domain models and their required interfaces kept together
        - Domain expresses capabilities it needs while remaining pure
        - Clear separation of domain logic from implementation details
        - Ubiquitous language shared across team and code
        - Bounded contexts to manage complexity
    1. **Pragmatic Functional Programming**
        - Immutability by default
        - Pure functions for domain logic
        - Effect tracking for managing side effects
        - Composable abstractions for flexibility
        - Domain interfaces express intent without implementation
        - Practical approach: use FP where it adds value
    1. **Test-Driven Development**
        - Write tests first to clarify requirements
        - Pure domain functions simplify testing
        - Effect substitution for integration points
        - Property-based testing for domain invariants
        - Test at appropriate levels (unit, integration, e2e)
    1. **Clean Code Principles**
        - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        - Meaningful names reflecting domain concepts
        - Small, focused functions and modules
        - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
        - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
        - Comments explain "why", not "what"
    1. **SOLID Principles in a Functional Context**
        - Open for extension through function composition
        - Liskov Substitution through parametric polymorphism
        - Interface Segregation via precise capability definition
        - Dependency Inversion with domain-defined interfaces
    1. **Continuous Integration and Delivery**
        - Automate testing and deployment
        - Frequent small releases
        - Feature flags for controlled rollouts
        - Monitoring and observability
    1. **Pragmatic Programmer Principles**
        - Tracer bullets: get working end-to-end skeleton quickly
        - Orthogonality: minimize dependencies between components
        - Reversibility: keep options open
        - "Good enough" software: balance perfectionism with deliver

# Functional Core

# Functional Core Approach: A Brief Overview

The Functional Core approach is an architectural pattern that organizes code into two main parts:

1. **Functional Core**:
    - Contains all domain models, business rules, and logic
    - Includes interfaces that express capabilities required by the domain
    - Uses functional programming techniques to keep business logic pure
    - Expresses effects (I/O, database access, etc.) abstractly through an effect system
    - Is entirely testable without mocks or external dependencies
1. **Imperative Shell**:
    - Surrounds the core with concrete implementations of interfaces
    - Handles all "messy" side effects and interactions with the outside world
    - Wires together the components and provides necessary dependencies

## Key Principles

- **Domain Completeness**: The domain expresses everything it needs within itself
- **Effect Isolation**: Side effects are expressed, not executed, within the core
- **Dependency Inversion**: The core defines what it needs; the shell provides it
- **Pure Business Logic**: Core business rules remain pure and free of implementation details
- **Natural Testability**: Business logic is easily testable without complex test doubles

## Advantages Over Traditional Layered Architecture

1. **Clearer Domain Expression**: Domain can fully articulate its needs and rules
2. **Reduced Fragmentation**: No need to split related domain concepts across layers
3. **Better Testing**: Pure functions are easier to test and reason about
4. **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies are clearly visible in function signatures
5. **Simplified Composition**: Core components can be easily composed and reused
